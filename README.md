# Sticky HDP-HMM for time series denoising

Suppose that we observed several time series and their underlying processes are discreted-valued. The sticky hidden-Markov model can be used to denoised these noisy time series. Run `python3 shdp_demo.py` to show a demonstration (with animation, see [demo on Youtube](https://youtu.be/7LhaXYANflQ)).
